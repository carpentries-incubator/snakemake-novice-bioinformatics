## Sample Dataset

This information specifically applies to the contents of the
`data-for-snakemake-novice-bioinformatics.tar.xz` file which you will need to download as part of
the standard setup for this course. This info is also included within the tar file
itself.

### Short read data

These originate from a dataset lodged in [ArrayExpress at EBI][aa]:

[ https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-MTAB-4044
](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-MTAB-4044)

As per the [BioStudies terms of use][bs] "New datasets in BioStudies are released into the public
domain under the terms of a Creative Commons Zero (CC0) waiver". This means you may legally use
the files for any purpose without attribution. However, if you do re-use the dataset it is basic
academic courtesy to state the accession *E-MTAB-4044*, and cite the paper:

> Lahtvee PJ, Kumar R, HallstrÃ¶m BM, Nielsen J.
> Adaptation to different types of stress converge on mitochondrial metabolism.
> Mol Biol Cell. 2016;27(15):2505-2514. doi:10.1091/mbc.E16-03-0187

The subset of the dataset included here was selected by the authors of the Snakemake lesson.

### Yeast transcriptome

This was downloaded from the [Ensembl yeast database][eyd], specifically this location:

[ https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-100/fasta/saccharomyces_cerevisiae/cdna/
](https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-100/fasta/saccharomyces_cerevisiae/cdna/)

The description provided by Ensembl states that:

> The data on this site is a direct import of the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) dataset for
> the Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C genome. The assembly provided is R64-1-1, supplemented with
> additional cross-references and annotations. The protein-coding and non-coding gene model
> annotation was imported from SGD in April 2018. This gene set is based on Liachko et al. 2013

The [SGD website][sgd] provides full information on appropriate citation of their genome builds,
but the appropriate papers to cite regarding this reference sequence are:

> Engel SR, Dietrich FS, Fisk DG, Binkley G, Balakrishnan R, Costanzo MC, Dwight SS, Hitz BC,
> Karra K, Nash RS, Weng S, Wong ED, Lloyd P, Skrzypek MS, Miyasato SR, Simison M, Cherry JM. (2013)
> The Reference Genome Sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae: Then and Now. G3 (Bethesda).
> 2013 Dec 27. pii: g3.113.008995v1. doi: 10.1534/g3.113.008995. [PMID: 24374639]

> Liachko I, Youngblood RA, Keich U, Dunham MJ.
