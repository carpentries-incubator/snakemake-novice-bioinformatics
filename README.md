## Snakemake for Bioinformatics

This lesson introduces the Snakemake workflow system in the context of a bioinformatics data
analysis task.

To quote from the [official Snakemake documentation](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/):

> The Snakemake workflow management system is a tool to create reproducible and scalable data analyses.
> Workflows are described via a human readable, Python based language. They can be seamlessly scaled to
> server, cluster, grid and cloud environments, without the need to modify the workflow definition.
> Finally, Snakemake workflows can entail a description of required software, which will be automatically
> deployed to any execution environment.

Snakemake originated as, and remains most popular as, a tool for bioinformatics. This is how we present
it here. However, Snakemake is a general-purpose system and may be used for all manner of data processing
tasks.

Snakemake is a superset of the Python language and as such can draw on the full power of Python, but you
do not need to be a Python programmer to use it. This lesson **assumes no prior knowledge of Python** and
intruduces just a few concepts as needed to construct useful workflows.
