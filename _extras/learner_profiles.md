## Xiu

Xiu just completed a PhD in microbiology and has taken up a postdoc role in a new lab. During her PhD she mostly
worked in the wet lab but also performed the data analysis for her project. Initially she tried to do this with Excel
but after attending an introductory Python course she continued self-learning and wrote some analysis scripts that ran
nicely on the department Linux server. Her new head-of-lab sees that Xiu has an aptitude for programming and has
asked her to adopt and extend some pipeline code that the lab uses to process their mouse fecal metabarcoding results.

At present the code only runs on one old Mac in the corner of the lab and is hard to configure as several input
parameters must be copied from a spreadsheet and then three steps need to be started manually over the course of several
hours. The code consists of a mixture of BASH scripts and Python written by a previous member of the team who has now
left. Xiu is enthusiastic but after two months wrestling with the codebase it just seems to be getting messier, and
the last time she tried to change something significant the code crashed part way through processing and had to be
reverted. She has adopted the approach of leaving the old code untouched wherever possible and writing new Python
wrappers to add functionality. Xiu fears she is out of her depth working with this codebase, but she really wants to
impress her new team and properly get to grips with the system.

The Snakemake Pipelines course will show Xiu how a data processing pipeline can be designed and constructed around
Snakemake workflows. It will teach how to configure those workflows in a logical way, making them robust and portable.
It will demonstrate how her existing Python knowledge can be applied in these new workflows. Ultimately, Xiu should
have the confidence to replace old problematic code with redesigned modules, and be able to articulate to her team the
benefits of this approach.

Xiu would also benefit from other lessons in The Carpentries, specifically on version control with git.

## Ahmad

Ahmad has worked for 12 years in the genotyping lab at Prestonfield University. His manager is encouraging him to
develop new skills in data analysis in order for Ahmad to progress his career and help the lab adapt to work with more
data-intensive techniques like RAD-seq. Ahmad has recently been on an introductory Linux course. He enjoyed this and
was able to work through the course material and complete most of the exercises, but felt himself to be slow and
struggling compared to others on the course, who seemed to be more computer-savvy.

Ahmad is still rather wary of putting his newfound Linux skills into practise. He mostly sticks to running the standard
commands which are part of the established process within the facility. He does not yet see himself as a prospective
bioinformatician or programmer but does recognise that there is an opportunity to be grasped and is a willing learner.

The Snakemake course will reinforce and build on the Linux knowledge that Ahmad gained from the earlier course. While
the example data used in the course in not exactly the type that he works with, the general approach should translate
to ideas that can be applied in the genotyping lab. After installing Snakemake onto the facility server, Ahmad will
gain the confidence to propose these new ideas to his manager and to start trying them out.

## Zoe

Zoe is a PI of a small research group that studies pesticide resistance in weevils. The group sends RNA samples
for Illumina sequencing and receives back raw results. Zoe has decent experience with the tools used for data
analysis, having worked hands-on with the first 5 datasets that were sequenced, and is known as a bit of an "R wizard".

Following the release of a new weevil genome, Zoe is looking at the feasibility of re-analysing her previous datasets
against the new genome build. A colleague suggested that Snakemake might help, and being a hands-on person she has
decided to attend the course herself, along with a postdoc from her lab. She's also considering that the reanalysis task
could form the basis of a project for a bioinformatics masters student, to be supervised by the postdoc. Either way, she
would like to understand how it all works, even if the life of a PI doesn't give much time for hands-on coding.
