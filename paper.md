# WORK IN PROGRESS

# Summary

* List all authors and affiliations.

* Describe the submission, and explain its eligibility for JOSE.

* Include a “Statement of Need” section, explaining how the submitted artifacts contribute to computationally enabled teaching and learning, and describing how they might be adopted by others.

* For learning modules, describe the learning objectives, content, instructional design, and experience of use in teaching and learning situations.

* Tell us the “story” of the project: how did it come to be?

* Cite key references, including a link to the open archive of the sofware or the learning module.
